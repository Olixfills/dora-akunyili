                Born Dora Nkem Edemobi on the 14th of July, 1954 in Markudi, Benue State, to Chief and Mrs Paul
                Young
                Edemobi whohailed from Nanka, Anambra State. Her father quickly recognised her
                intelligence, and sent her to live with her mother’s brother who was a school teacher. She
                attended
                St.
                Patrick's Primary School, Isuofia, Anambra State, where she received her First School Leaving
                Certificate in 1966. She then moved on to Queen of the Rosary Secondary School Nsukka, Enugu
                State
                where
                she received her West African School Certificate Examination (W.A.S.C.E) in 1973. She graduated
                with
                Grade I Distinction and won the Eastern Nigerian Government Post Primary Scholarship, and the
                Federal
                Government of Nigeria Undergraduate Scholarship. For her undergraduate studies, she attended the
                University of Nigeria, Nsukka (U.N.N), and in
                her third year of studies, she got married to Dr Chike Akunyili who supported his wife’s
                Pharmacology studies. She graduated from the university in 1978 with a B.Pharm, after which
                she took graduate classes in the University of London, England. Between 1978 and 2000, She
                worked briefly as a university hospital pharmacist and then entered the Ph.D. program at the
                University of Nigeria and worked there as a graduate assistant, lecturer, senior lecturer, and
                finally (in 2000) professor. She received her Ph.D. in ethno-pharmacology in the same university
                in
                1985. Prof. Dora Akunyili died of Uterine cancer on the 7th of June 2014, having battled with
                the
                ailment for two years. The tumor she had was said to be malignant,hence, efforts to remove it
                was
                inefficacious. She was survived by her husband and their six children. Her daughter Nkem
                Akunyili
                revealed in an interview, how her mother wasn’t just a mother to her and her siblings, but to
                many,
                how
                she was always ready to listen to and help them, never turning anyone away.

            <h3>Why she is a role model to many (female)</h3>
            <p>
                Akunyili is an iconic woman who is known for her strength and courage in her tenure as DG of
                NAFDAC as she fought against drug counterfeiting in the nation. There were several attempts on
                her life by drug counterfeiters as she stopped them from carrying out their business as usual, but
                that didn’t stop her or slow her down. Instead it strengthened her resolve to see drug
                counterfeiting in Nigeria drop to its lowest level in decades, which she did successfully. She was
                also known for her honesty and integrity. It was while demonstrating such that she was
                invited to Apply as DG of NAFDAC. While she served as the Zonal secretary for PTF she had a
                strange ailment and was sponsored to go to Britain for treatment with 17,000 pounds, surgery
                supposed to cost 12,000 pounds and tests, treatment and other cost 5,000 pounds, but apparently, she
                was wrongly diagnosed in Nigeria and didn’t need the surgery. She then asked the hospital for
                a refund of 12,000 pounds so she could return it to her employers, which she did. The President of
                Nigeria at the time Chief Olusegun Obasanjo heard of her act and then gave her the job to
                sanitize NAFDAC.
