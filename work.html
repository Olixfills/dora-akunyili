                Along with her academic work in U.N.N, Akunyili was selected to fill government posts. She served
                on several state government boards and then was named supervisory councilor for agriculture in a
                local government unit in Anambra state. In 1996, she became Zonal Secretary of Petroleum
                (Special) Trust Fund (PTF) for the South Eastern part of Nigeria, a trust fund that is given a
                percentage of Nigeria's oil revenue to be used in providing infrastructural facilities for the
                entire country. She was then invited to apply for the post of Director General (DG) of NAFDAC.
                She served in this position from 2001 – 2009 and was successful in her fight against drug
                counterfeiting in Nigeria. She also put in place WADRAN (West Africa Drug Regulatory Authority
                Network) in collaboration with other West African food and drug regulators. This served as a
                platform for interacting with other drug and food regulators in other regions of West Africa to
                combat drug counterfeiting and also making the regions hostile for the drug couterfeiters in
                those regions. After her time at NAFDAC, she was appointed as the federal minister of information and
                communication between 2008 –2010. During her time in this role, she invented the slogan "Good
                People, Great Nation." She later ran for election in 2011 as Senator for Anambra Central for the All
                Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). She was defeated by Chris Ngige of the Action Congress of Nigeria
                (ACN).
